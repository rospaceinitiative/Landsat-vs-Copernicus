# LANDSAT vs COPERNICUS Workshop

This GitHub repository will help you understand a comparison between **Landsat** and **Copernicus** using the use case of **Heat Island**. We will use **Landsat 8** and **Copernicus 3** as satellite data and will use **Google Earth Engine** and the **Copernicus API** as data sources.

**Prerequisites**:
1. Create an account on [https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/).
2. Validate the account through email.
3. Remember your username and password.

**Platform Requirements**:
This code is optimized to work on **Linux subsystems**. If you are using Windows, it is recommended to install **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux): [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

### Required Libraries
You will need **Python 3** installed on your computer and the following libraries:

- `earthengine-api`
- `folium`
- `geemap`
- `geojson`
- `numpy`
- `requests`
- `shapely`
- `xarray`

To install these libraries, you can use:
```bash
