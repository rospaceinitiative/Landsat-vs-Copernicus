# LANDSAT vs COPERNICUS Workshop

This GitHub repository will help you understand a comparison between Landsat and Copernicus using the use case of Heat Island. We will use Landsat 8 and Copernicus 3 as satellite data and will use Google Earth Engine and Copernicus API as data sources. Before we start, you need to have an account on [https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/), to validate the account through email, and to remember your username and password.

All the code is meant to work on Linux subsystems, so if you are using Windows, we recommend you install WSL: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). You will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer and the following libraries:

- ee
- datetime
- geemap
- subprocess
- json
- time
- sys
- os
- requests
- folium
- shapely
- numpy

We hope that you enjoy this, and for any other questions, please contact the speaker at: simonel.david@rospin.org
